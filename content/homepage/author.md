*In the Heart of the Sea* is a non-fiction book detailing the events surrounding the last voyage of the whale ship *Essex*.
Specifically her destruction, which inspired Herman Melville's *Moby Dick*, and the longer story of her crews desperate voyage to South America.
In it we learn of the desperate measures the officers took to keep the crew alive.
And about the culture which produced such hardy men.
